# The changelog not only lists the significant changes in the interface,
# but provides a mechanism to hook into the tour or display a help menu.
# The changelog is an array of _version_ objects. Each version has a summary
# and an array of changes. Versions listed in descending order, the array
# can also be accessed by version, e.g. changelog['2.0.0']
