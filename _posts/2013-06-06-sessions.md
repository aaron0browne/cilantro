Cilantro has support for opening/closing sessions with API endpoints. It relies on [HATEOAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) by requesting to a single endpoint and _discovering_ the set of available URLs it can make use of in the application. Application components that rely on specific URLs must be able to fail gracefully.

## Open Session

Takes a `url` and optional `credentials` if the endpoint requires authentication. `credentials` are in the format `{username: 'foo', password: 's3kr1t'}`.

```javascript
require(['cilantro'], function(c) {
    // Takes a Serrano API endpoint
    c.openSession('/api/', /* credentials */);
});
```

## Close Session

```javascript
require(['cilantro'], function(c) {
    c.closeSession();
});
```
